                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We are a Data Controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (Data Protection Law).
                    This means that we are responsible for, and control the processing of, your personal information
                    with us.


                    We want to reassure you that we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy, and that
                    your personal and private information is stored and processed in a fair, lawful, and transparent
                    way.
                </p>


                <h4>When We Collect Your Information</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    We may collect your information when you interact with us directly. This includes when you ask
                    about, or use the services we provide; when we contact you to provide a service or follow up call;
                    when you make and attend appointments; when you communicate with us via the website or you provide
                    us with other personal information.
                </p>


                <h4>What Information We Collect About You</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>


                    Personal information we collect includes details such as your name, date of birth, email address,
                    postal address, telephone numbers, as well as other information you provide in any interaction with

                    telephone, email or by other means, we will treat it with confidentiality – always in accordance
                    with this Privacy Policy.

                <h4>Client Case Notes</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>


                    What clients say to us is confidential but there are limits to confidentiality.


                    As a therapist I engage in regular supervision, which means discussing aspects of my work with an
                    experienced independent supervisor and the Manager. This is to ensure I am working ethically and
                    within my competence. There are also things I must pass on to others. For example:

                    · When there is a legal requirement to disclose information related to a criminal offence.

                    · When there is a serious risk of harm to yourself or someone else.

                    · If you make a disclosure about a child or vulnerable adult that may be at risk of harm / has been
                    harmed ( a child is anyone under 18 years of age )

                    · If you tell me about an act of terrorism or any knowledge of terrorist activity.
                </p>
